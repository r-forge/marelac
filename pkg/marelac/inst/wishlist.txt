Thomas' Wishlist



- add word limnology to descriptions and titles where appropriate (DESCRIPTION, marelac.Rd)

  - suggestion: simply change "marine and lacustrine sciences" to "marine and limnological sciences",
  - mention the word "lacustrine" elsewhere.

- marelac is currently a mix of untility functions and teaching tutorials. Is this appropriate?
