Thomas' ToDo and Wishlist
***Karline's remarks****

***For density one has to use kg/m3, but for concentrations, molar units
are preferred (even for biologists). I am not used to think in g/m3,
and for modelling this really complicates things. So I suggest to use moles. ****

- solve inconsistencies between saturation formulae:
  - satconc: mu mol/L      N2, O2, Ar
  - O2sat: mg / L          only O2
  - note also that rho(seacarb) and rhoH2O use kg/m3

- add word limnology to descriptions and titles where appropriate (DESCRIPTION, marelac.Rd)
*** So we should change the name then: Marelim - sounds nice, why not
(marelac is the name of the masters in which I teach ecological modelling and R-intro) ***
  - suggestion: simply change "marine and lacustrine sciences" to "marine and limnological sciences",
  - mention the word "lacustrine" elsewhere.

- marelac is currently a mix of untility functions and teaching tutorials. Is this appropriate?
*** Clearly you find it inappropriate;
it is true, it is an ambivalent package.
 we can use marelac for the teaching, and create marelim for the science.
Sounds good?  ****
