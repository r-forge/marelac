Thomas' ToDo and Wishlist


- solve inconsistencies between saturation formulae:
  - satconc: mu mol/L      N2, O2, Ar
  - O2sat: mg / L          only O2
  - note also that rho(seacarb) and rhoH2O use kg/m3

- add word limnology to descriptions and titles where appropriate (DESCRIPTION, marelac.Rd)

  - suggestion: simply change "marine and lacustrine sciences" to "marine and limnological sciences",
  - mention the word "lacustrine" elsewhere.

- marelac is currently a mix of untility functions and teaching tutorials. Is this appropriate?
