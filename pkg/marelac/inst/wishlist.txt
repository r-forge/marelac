Karline STILL TO BE DONE:
1. check: solubility: P in atm or in bar??
2. check mol.vol values. also has a P issue!


DONE
3. decide about mol_weight, molweight or mol2weight (see below)
--decided: molvol and molweight

4. we should fix some style issues. I'm a litle bit lazy about this,
but this gets even more important if additional developers are in the
boat.

- split functions (one file per *exported* function - done...

don't understand:
- style of comments
- style of braces
- capitalization of lists
- form of citation
- file naming .R .Rd (and not .r, .rd) -- ThPe can rename it.
- anything else?



Thomas:

Question: mol_vol and mol_weight?

Answer:
- maybe also:
  mol2vol, mol2weight  (clearly identify conversion)
  molvol, molweight (simpler, my preference) or
  Karline, please decide.

Question: convert_t ? from dgC to dgK to dgFahrenheit.
Answer: function convert_T added
thanks

vertmean: 
- do not understand NN,        -- solved, m a.s.l.
- difficult example?           -- I'll think about it
verttotal would also be useful -- added option "total" to vertmean

thanks
