To do
  Add bathymetry to marelac (is now in marelac.teaching)
  Filip: 1. check for more refined bathymetry - but not too large file
         2. per bathymetric grid cell: the surface area...

Karline done
  1. checked molvol; OK
  
  2. conversion to SI units as far as possible : cm -> m, day or hour -> sec
  (also ssd2rad: now J/m2/s)
  
Ka -> ThPe
  Inconsistent use of x and q in molweight and Redfield

  1. molweight(species)
  
  All the other functions:
  molvol(x,...)
  
  suggestion: molweight(species)
  

  2. Redfield(x,...)
  
  Other functions, e.g.
  molvol(,... q,...)
  (q for quantity)
  
  suggest: Redfield(q,...)
