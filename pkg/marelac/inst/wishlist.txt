Inconsistency satconc solved.
Added new satconcs and solubility, added gas transfer velocities (marine only).

ThPe: T = 25 is now the default, argument K= ... removed


TO DO

**** Thomas **** :

1.  these arguments are dangerous:
... T = K - 273.15, K = T+273.15,...
if T nor K are specified, it gives a weird error ("..promise already under evaluation.."),
because it cannot resolve which is the Temperature to use.

I (KS) Suggest to take T=25 the default (as in seacarb), e.g.
..., T = 25, K = T+273.15 ,....

==> solved, see 2008-12-09

2.  update vignette with your functions.


**** All**** : Check **Pressure**:

  true atmospheric pressure or hydrostatic pressure,
  units of atmosphere, bar, decibar.
  
ThPe:
  - suggestion: use consistently bar or Pa
  - note function "baroconv"
  
  
Decide which is most appropriate for each function!...


**** Karline/Filip **** viscosity and diffusion coefficients;
now function estimates all of them, should allow to select one..

Please document function "gastransfer" (see empty .Rd template)


QUESTION

Functions solubility and schmidt use a table of coefficients.

Is it wise to have the table of coefficients part of the function or would it be better
to make it a (private) dataset (and is this possible).
